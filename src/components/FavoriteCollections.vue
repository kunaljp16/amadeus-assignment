Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody is both a decorated hero and a serious threat. CIA officer Carrie Mathison is tops in her field despite being bipolar. The delicate dance these two complex characters perform, built on lies, suspicion, and desire, is at the heart of this gripping, emotional thriller in which nothing short of the fate of our nation is at stake.</p>",

If she's your therapist, you've got problems. Emmy AwardÂ® winner Lisa Kudrow co-created, produces and stars in this outrageous therapeutic send-up.
